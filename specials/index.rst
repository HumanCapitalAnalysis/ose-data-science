We discuss selected topics in more details based on student demands.

======================
Tools for data science
======================

We make use of `Python <https://www.python.org>`_, its `SciPy ecosystem <https://www.scipy.org>`_, and `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_ throughout the course. We will explore some of the tools mentioned on the `website <open-econ.org/resources/>`_.

============================
Structural microeconometrics
============================

We discuss the basic motivation behind structural econometric modeling. We quickly focus on the class of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models that are often used in labor economics to study human capital accumulation and discuss their economic model, mathematical formulation, and alternative calibration procedures. We explore the seminal work outlined in `Keane & Wolpin (1994) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109768?>`_ as an example. A set of lecture notes is available `online <https://ekw-lectures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
