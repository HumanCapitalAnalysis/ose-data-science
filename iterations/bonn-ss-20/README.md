We will conduct all course communications using the bonn-econ-teaching [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) chat, so please be sure to join us there. To join the Zulip organization, please click on the button below. By default, you will already be subscribed to Q&A and tech support streams (=chatrooms). You need to **manually subscribe to the microeconometrics stream** to receive all the messages for this course. There I also post the link to the online lectures using [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/). Find out how to join a stream on Zulip [here](https://bonn-econ-teaching.zulipchat.com).

## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics/blob/master/README.md).

#### Kickoff

* [OpenSourceEconomics](https://opensourceeconomics.github.io/)

We briefly present our efforts around this student run initiative that offers numerous opportunities to get involved.

## Student projects

We will run student projects for grading and heavily rely on [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). In this project you are asked to summarize and reproduce core results of an empirical paper of your choice. Please select an article that interests you but also allows you to access the data used in the analysis. Also, for a good grade you need to add some analysis of your own. This can take very different forms. For example, you could create some visualizations that make the paper more accessible to interested readers, investigate the sensitivity of results to the author's modeling choices, or add some additional robustness checks.

All details regarding the general setup are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template).

### Frequently asked questions

We collect a set up of questions here as well:

* **Do we need to report on the progress of our project?**

  * Yes, I will frequently select a student project at random to report on their current state at the end of a lecture.


* **When is the student project due?**

  * The project is due on the 17th of July.


* **Why are the projects public?**

  * Transparency and reproducibility is a core value in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.


* **When do I need to sign up for the project?**

  * You need to register with the examination office between the 28th of April and 4th of May.


* **How can I initialize the repository for my student project?**

  * Please just follow this invitation [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/AIR1HxcC).


* **Can we work in groups?**

  * No, everybody has to work on their own project.


* **Do I get any extra credit for ensuring full reproducibility of my project using Travis CI?**

  * Yes, everybody who successfully sets up a continuous integration workflow will get an extra bump in their grade.
