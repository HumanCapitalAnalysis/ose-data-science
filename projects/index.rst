We will run student projects for grading and heavily rely on `GitHub Classroom <https://classroom.github.com>`_. In this project you are asked to summarize and reproduce core results of an empirical paper of your choice. Please select an article that interests you but also allows you to access the data used in the analysis. Also, for a good grade you need to add some analysis of your own. This can take very different forms. For example, you could create some visualizations that make the paper more accessible to interested readers, investigate the sensitivity of results to the author's modeling choices, or add some additional robustness checks. All details regarding the general setup are available `here <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-template-course-project-data-science>`_

Excellent projects are kindly provided by `Annica Gehlen <https://github.com/amageh>`_, `Pascal Heid <https://github.com/Pascalheid>`_, `Felix Kirsch <https://github.com/felix0496>`_.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

We collect a set up of questions here as well:

{% octicon light-bulb height:16 %}

* **Do we need to report on the progress of our project?** Yes, I will frequently select a student project at random to report on their current state at the end of a lecture.

* **Why are the projects public?** Transparency and reproducibility is a core value in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.

* **How can I initialize the repository for my student project?** Please just follow this invitation `link <https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/37739145-ose-data-science>`_.

* **Can we work in groups?** No, everybody has to work on their own project.

* **Do I get any extra credit for ensuring full reproducibility of my project using GitHub Actions?** Yes, everybody who successfully sets up a continuous integration workflow will get an extra bump in their grade.

* **Where can I look for publications that provide the data behind their research?** Some journals provide the data for their published articles as data supplements directly on their website. In addition, the `Replication Wiki <http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_  and the `Harvard Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu>`_ compile a lot such information.

* **What are other useful resources for research data?** There is a tremendous amount of data available online. For example, MDRC provides a host of data files for public use `here <https://www.mdrc.org/available-public-use-files>`_ from the evaluation of public policy initiatives. More generally, `Google Dataset Search <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com>`_ allows to look for all kinds of online data.
