Our course equips students with the required skills in statistics, technology, and communication to use data for decision-making. Our partnerships with the private and public sector connect students directly with employment opportunities that match their interests and skill set.

Private sector

`Ernst & Young <https://www.ey.com/de_de>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Alexander Sommer <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-sommer-ey>`__, Manager Advanced Analytics, provided us with an overview of the statistical methodologies used for his consulting services. His talk focused on two case studies. First, he and his team applied outlier detection methods, cluster analysis, and simulation methods to improve the quality assurance for a major manufacturer in the automobile sector. Second, he reported on his experience working with the public sector regarding the development of an online recommendation engine. Throughout his presentation, Alexander emphasized the need for data visualization and a structured workflow to facilitate communication with clients.

The slides of his lecture are available `here <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-course-data-science/blob/master/partners/E%26Y.pdf>`_.

`McKinsey & Company <https://www.mckinsey.de/>`_

`Nils Wittmann <https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-wittmann-373a0040/?originalSubdomain=de>`__, Analytics Expert, explained how his company uses the latest analytical tools to improve the internal processes of his clients and their interaction with customers. In addition, Nils shared his experiences from two recent projects. First, he reported on the use of regression models and machine learning techniques to tackle customer churn. Second, he presented an ensemble approach to forecast customer demand. Both projects illustrated the need for visualization and communication skills, in addition to technical knowledge, to bridge the gap between data insights and business value. 

Public sector

`Bundesrechnungshof <https://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/de>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Sebastian Garmann <https://sites.google.com/site/garmannsebastian/>`__, Peter Ko√ü and Gregor Teischler were part of the Data Science team from the Bundesrechnungshof who explained how they implement data analytics on audits for public institutions in order to make public policies more efficient. One case study mentioned during the lecture focused on an audit for making public communication more effective between public institutions. For this, they applied quantitative analysis (i.e., quantiles and distributions), as well as qualitative analysis (i.e., text mining). In this regard, they performed Word Clouds, Network Graphs, and Sentiment Scores to asses how well federal agencies communicate.
