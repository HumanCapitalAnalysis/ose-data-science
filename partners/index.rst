**Ernst & Young (E&Y)**

Ernst & Young (E&Y) is a multinational firm that provides a wide range of services to its clients such as financial audit; operations; technology consulting; financial services; among others. 

Alexander Sommer, Manager of Data Analytics at E&Y, collaborated with us by presenting a lecture on the statistical methodologies used by the firm to provide technology consulting services.

In particular, two examples stand out from his lecture. First, the Data Analytics department at E&Y applied outlier detection methods, cluster analysis and simulation methods for a project related to quality managment and assurance for a major manufacturer in the automobile sector. Also, they run simulations with Patefield's algorithm to show the join distribution of some variables. This result later developed into the idea of replacing costly inputs for more cost-efficient ones.

In another setting, the team at E&Y provided technology consulting to a organization in the public sector regarding an online recommendation engine. Here, the team evaluated the feasibility of different methodological approaches following a well-structured workflow for data analytics: i) data understanding; ii) data preparation; iii) association rule learning; iv) sequential pattern mining; v) logistic regression; vi) recommendation for the implementation phase of the project.
